# Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies.

## API
The [RESTful API](https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/keggapi.html) provides information about how to query the KEGG database.

## Data
The KEGG API enables retrieving a list of all of the following entites:
* Compound
* Orthology
* Pathway
* Reaction
