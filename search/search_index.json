Over time, as the alliance adds additional data types, individual MOD ingests can be replaced by collective Alliance ingest. The Alliance has bulk data downloads, ingest data formats, and an API. The preference should be bulk downloads first, followed by ingest formats, finally by API calls. In some cases it may continue to be more practical to load from individual MODs when data is not yet fully harmonized in the Alliance. Alliance Bulk Downloads Alliance schemas Gene Information Genes for all Alliance species (Human, Rat, Mouse, Fish, Fly, Worm, Yeast) are loaded using the BGI formatted ingest files, as there are no Gene export files.
